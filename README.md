# JS algorithms with JEST

This repository serves as a playground for solving `freeCodeCamp` `JavaScript` algorithms with the help of `JEST` (Delightful JavaScript Testing).

For each algorithm will be created separate folder, which will have its own readme file (what problem to solve and some test examples to check if it works).

List of algorithms:

1. Reverse a string.
1. Factorialize a Number
1. Check for Palindromes
